COLLATZ ALGORITHM AND CONJECTURE

The Colallatz Algorithm is breifly:
if a number is even, divide by 2
if a number is odd, mulitply by 3 and add one

The conjecture is the assumtion/fact that every postive integer will result in a loop of 4,2,1,4,2,1...
Due to this the array outputs wll end when a one is hit, and positive integers are the only accepted inputs.
